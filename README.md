Data Science - Getting and Cleaning Data
----------------------------------------

This repository contains the course project for ***Getting and Cleaning Data Course*** / Data Science Track in Coursera.

It contains only one code file, which has multiple "inner" functions that divide the program in smaller, easy to debug, code. 

The program will download the project source data if necessary, it will perform all 5 steps and generate the resulting data as "results.txt" file.

The CookBook can be found in CooBook.md, that file will describe all steps and the transformations applied to the source data.
